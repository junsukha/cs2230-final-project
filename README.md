# 3D physical Simulation of balls

## Introduction  

+ Frist simulation: We use a sphere and a cube to show physical movement sphere usign gravity (acceleration considered). When you run the program, the ball (sphere) fall from the top to the cube and bounce until it stops. After it stops, you can tilt the cube left and right using arrow keys. The ball will roll left or right accordingly (acceleration and deceleration considered). The movement doesn't exactly follow physics rule; we had to manipulate the magnitude of speed as the cordinates were too small.

+ Second simulation: We also tried using multiples of spheres in a cube and make spheres interact each other as well as a cube using gravity and collision.

+ Current verison of code only runs first simulation. Need to use the latest version to simulate the second one.

## Installation and Run  
No installation needed. Just copy whole files and open in Qt using CMakeList.txt.
