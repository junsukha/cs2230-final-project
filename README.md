# 3D physical rendering using a sphere  

## Introduction  

We use a sphere and a cube to show physical movement sphere usign gravity (acceleration considered). When you run the program, the ball (sphere) fall from the top to the cube and bounce until it stops. After it stops, you can tilt the cube left and right using arrow keys. The ball will roll left or right accordingly (acceleration and deceleration considered). The movement doesn't exactly follow physics rule; we had to manipulate the magnitude of speed as the cordinates were too small.

## Installation and Run  
No installation needed. Just copy whole files and open in Qt using CMakeList.txt.
